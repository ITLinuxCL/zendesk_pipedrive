You can clone this repo and build the package as explained here: [Installing and using the Zendesk apps tools](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203691236) or download it directly from here [zendesk_pipedrive-latest.zip](https://raw.github.com/ITLinuxCL/zendesk_pipedrive/master/package/zendesk_pipedrive-latest.zip).

Then you have to install it following this guide [Uploading and installing your private app in Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203691246). 

### Why?
We used to use [Highrise](http://www.highrisehq.com) but given that is hasn't received any improvent, we moved to [Pipedrive](http://www.pipedrive.com), but we couldn't read our contact information.

So we built it our selfs.

### The following information is displayed:

* Company name
* Person name
* Person Phone
* Person Email

If the contact does not exists on Pipedrive, it let you create it.

Please submit bug reports hera as Issues. Pull requests are welcome.
