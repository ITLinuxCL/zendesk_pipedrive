# Zendesk Pipedrive contact information

Display and update contact information from [Pipedrive](http://www.pipedrive.com) directly on [Zendesk](http://www.zendesk.com).

### Why?
We used to use [Highrise](http://www.highrisehq.com) but given that is hasn't received any improvent, we moved to [Pipedrive](http://www.pipedrive.com), but we couldn't read our contact information.

So we built it our selfs.

### The following information is displayed:

* Company name
* Person name
* Person Phone
* Person Email

If the contact does not exists on Pipedrive, it let you create it.

Please submit bug reports hera as Issues. Pull requests are welcome.
